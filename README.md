# Phishing Email Detection Feature Extractor

This Python script extracts features from an email text to determine the likelihood of it being a phishing email. It calculates a phishing probability based on the presence of certain features within the email text.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Open the script file (`phishing_feature_extractor.py`) in a text editor.
3. Modify the `email_text` variable to contain the text of the email you want to analyze.
4. Run the script using Python.

## Features Extracted

The script extracts the following features from the email text:

- **Contains HTTP/HTTPS:** Checks if the email text contains 'http' or 'https' URLs.
- **Contains '@' symbol:** Checks if the email text contains the '@' symbol.
- **Contains dot:** Checks if the email text contains a dot ('.').
- **Contains dollar sign:** Checks if the email text contains the dollar sign ('$').
- **Contains exclamation mark:** Checks if the email text contains an exclamation mark ('!').
- **Contains question mark:** Checks if the email text contains a question mark ('?').
- **Contains percent sign:** Checks if the email text contains a percent sign ('%').
- **Contains numbers:** Checks if the email text contains any numeric characters.
- **Word count:** Calculates the total number of words in the email text.
- **Average word length:** Calculates the average length of words in the email text.

## Phishing Probability Calculation

The script calculates a phishing probability based on the presence of the extracted features. It sums up the presence of each feature and divides it by the total number of features. If the phishing probability is greater than 0.5, the email is considered likely to be a phishing attempt.

## Important Notes

- This script is for educational purposes only.
- Use this script responsibly and ethically.
- The results of the phishing probability calculation may vary based on the features extracted and the characteristics of the email text.
- Consider additional features and validation techniques for more accurate phishing detection.
